# serverless-platform
Its a Platform build out of the [@serverless-framework](https://github.com/serverless-framework) that is Invented by [@DIREKTSPEED](https://github.com/direktspeed/) to run Serverless code in Your Local Private or a External Hosting Environment as also Local Computers. The Main Highlevel Tooling and SDK Parts are Maintained under [@serverless-platform](https://github.com/serverless-platform) if you only want to Code Serverless Functions and Deploy them your Probaly searching for [@serverless](https://github.com/serverless) a Toolkit for Development and Deployment of Serverless functions for popular Serverless Providers written in NodeJS.

DIREKTSPEED Serverless Platform Offers a Unified Infrastructure that aims to Solve all The Problems of any Kappa Architecture (or Lambda Architecture) where still the CAP theorem Applys.
Read here about the Problem [How to beat the CAP theorem](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/how-to-beat-the-cap-theorem.html). Our Software Stack allows you to care less about Servers and Hardware so you can focus on Running and Inventing your Solutions. It offers also Opinionated Solutions for all kinds of Software Development Cases so you don't need to Choose Technology we simply Provide you with the Best Solutions out of the Opensource Ecosystem for every Case with Unifyed Support and API's as also ABI's from High Level Coding Languages till Low Level OS (Kernel) and Hardware bindings.

It can also be Distributed over 100000 Servers or Instances for Computation. Core Technologys that are envolved are: SystemD, The Kappa Architecture, Couchbase, Docker, Unikernels, Unix and Unixoid Systems, Low and High level Coding Languages. We will simplyfy the Core Technology under the Term Open Source Software. And we want to Say Thank You to All Contributors to that Term who ever and where ever they Are you All Are Amazing!!!! If you want to learn more about the framework parts of Serverless Platform look into [@serverless-framework](https://github.com/serverless-framework)


## small till middle use cases
Run it on your Local Development Environment to make it easy to Code and manage the common stuff, while preparing your code to do the impossible via Scaling out to Our Enterprise Ready Realtime Solutions with the Couchbase Event SDK that is a part of the new @serverless-platform-database Organisation to Bundle our Couchbase distribution for the Serverless Platform.

## Enterprise use cases with our Couchbase distribution and tooling (Serverless Platform Database) SPDB
This Section Explains how to take this Concepts even more Far with a Couchbase Event SDK Centric Tier as Distributed Message Queue we call it the SPDB (Serverless Platform Database) Stack that is build around Couchbase which is Fully Event driven. A Total new Way to code Your InHouse and Cloud Applications using only the serverless-platform SDK from DIREKTSPEED to Code your Applcations.

It Integrates Couchbase with distributed Serverless code only that executes and Scales on Demand with RealTime Analytics and Log Managment! So it can be seen as the Wet Dream of Every Coder and Company! We use this analogy because we are Managing some of the Most high Trafficed Websites in the World that are out of the Porn Industrie and Combine the learnings and knowleg so the overall expirence into Our DIREKTSPEED Products that are again Open Source so every one can Contribute his individual Expirence to make it easy to to do the common stuff, while helping you build the impossible. We are also Enforcing Build to Last Paradigms. And Call it The engagement SDK

### End Goal
~~A Dream of us that we are working still on is to Combine that with Unikernel's while we are at present near to that future we are not there already. We See that as the Final State to Deploy Serverless Code and Couchbase as Real Unikernel Builds.~~

We Reached now Our Full Goal. All Parts are now deploy able as Unikernel's and Containers

# Description of Serverless Platform and Direktspeed as a whole
DIREKTSPEED can be seen as the First Opensource Only Software House that ingreds them all! Even the Biggest like Microsoft, Google, SAP, IBM. Oracle. To Deliver the Worlds Best Software Solutions for every case via a Unifed Architecture and Infrastructure Called Serverless Platform which is driven by the best out of All Opensource Software on the Market.

# We Need You All
at present we have a High demand on Copyright Specialists as also Writers and Coders out of the OpenSource Ecosystems that we use as Framework and Infrastructure Parts. We want to List some here so you can easy Find what you can deliver to make all this Your Success!
