# serverless-platform
Its a Platform Toolkit to run Serverless code like lambda kappa via a Amazon ECS like Hosting Environment

## small till middle use cases
Run it on your Local Development Environment without the Couchbase Event SDK to make it easy to Code and manage the common stuff, while preparing your code to do the impossible.

## Enterprise use cases with Couchbase Event SDK
This Section Explains how to take this Concepts even more Far with a Couchbase Event SDK Centric Tier as Distributed Message Queue we call it the SPCE (Serverless Couchbase Event Driven) Stack. A Total new Way to code Your InHouse and Cloud Applications using only the serverless-platform sdk and the couchbase-event sdk from DIREKTSPEED to Code your Applcations.

It Replaces or Integrates with Kubernets to Run your distributed Serverless code only on Demand with RealTime Analytics and Log Managment! So it can be seen as the Wet Dream of Every Coder and Company! We use this analogy because we are Managing some of the Most high Trafficed Websites in the World that are out of the Porn Industrie and Combine the learnings and knowleg so the overall expirence into Our DIREKTSPEED Products that are again Open Source so every one can Contribute his individual Expirence to make it easy to to do the common stuff, while helping you build the impossible.


### End Goal
A Dream of us that we are working still on is to Combine that with Unikernel's while we are at present near to that future we are not there already. We See that as the Final State to Deploy Serverless Code and Couchbase as Real Unikernel Builds.
